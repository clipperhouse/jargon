In 1664, the city was named in honor of the [[Duke of York]], who would become King [[James II of England]]. James's older brother, King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], had appointed the Duke [[Proprietary colony|proprietor]] of the former territory of [[New Netherland]], including the city of [[New Amsterdam]], which England had recently seized from the Dutch.<ref name="Archdeacon2013a">{{cite book|authorlink1=Thomas J.

===Early history===

In the [[Pre-Columbian era|precolonial era]], the area of present-day New York City was inhabited by [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] Native Americans, including the [[Lenape]]. Their homeland, known as [[Lenapehoking]], included Staten Island, Manhattan, the Bronx, the western portion of Long Island (including the areas that would later become the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens), and the [[Lower Hudson Valley]].<ref>Evan T.
