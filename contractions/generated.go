package contractions

// This file is generated. Best not to modify it, as it will likely be overwritten.

// Dictionary for expanding common contractions into distinct words. Examples:
//	don't → does not
//	we've → we have
//	she's -> she is
// Caveats:
// - only lower case right now; TODO: add support for title case and all uppercase?
// - returns expanded words as a single string with a space in it; caller might wish to re-tokenize
var Dictionary = &dictionary{
	variations: variations,
}

// remember maps do not guarantee order, so this will look random
